# *pyPPG* toolbox documentation

A toolbox for finger photoplethysmogram (PPG) analysis, including beat detection, fiducial point detection, and comprehensive assessment of standard biomarkers.

## Introduction
***pyPPG*** is a standardised toolbox to analyze long-term finger PPG recordings in real-time. The toolbox extracts state-of-the-art PPG biomarkers (_i.e._ pulse wave features) from PPG signals. The algorithms implemented in the *pyPPG* toolbox have been validated on freely available PPG databases.
Consequently, *pyPPG* offers robust and comprehensive assessment of clinically relevant biomarkers from continuous PPG signals.

## Description
The following steps are implemented in the ***pyPPG*** toolbox:

1. **Loading a raw PPG signal**: The toolbox can accept PPG signals in various file formats such as *.mat*, *.txt*, *.csv*, or *.edf*. These files should contain raw PPG data along with the corresponding sampling rate.
   * *.mat*: Data should be stored in two variables within the file: (i) 'Fs' representing the sampling frequency, and (ii) 'Data', a vector containing the raw PPG signal.
   * *.txt*: The raw PPG signal should be stored in tabular form (single tab or space-delimited), and you need to provide the sampling frequency as an input parameter to the script using 'fs'.
   * *.csv*: This format stores raw PPG signal data with comma separation. Similar to .txt, the sampling frequency must be provided as an input parameter to the script using 'fs'.
   * *.edf*: The [European Data Format](https://www.edfplus.info/) is supported, and it applies 'Pleth' channel by default. However, if using a different channel name, then the user needs to define it themselves.
3. **Preprocessing**: The raw signal is filtered to remove unwanted noise and artifacts. Subsequently, the signal is resampled to 75 Hz.
3. **Pulse wave segmentation**: The toolbox employs a peak detector to identify the systolic peaks. It uses an [improved version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10398) of a beat detection algorithm originally proposed in [(*Aboy et al. 2005*)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2005.855725). Based on the peak locations, the toolbox also detects the pulse onsets and offsets, which indicate the start and end of the PPG pulse waves.
4. **Fiducial points identification**: For each pulse wave, the toolbox detects a set of fiducial points.
5. **Biomarker engineering**: Based on the fiducial points, a set of 74 PPG digital biomarkers (_i.e._ pulse wave features) are calculated.

The *pyPPG* toolbox also provides an optional PPG signal quality index based on the Matlab implementation of the work by [(*Li et al. 2015*)](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/PhysioNetChallengePublic/blob/master/2015/sample-submission/ppgSQI.m).

The toolbox identifies individual pulse waves in a PPG signal by identifying ***systolic peaks (sp)***, and then identifying the ***pulse onset (on)*** and ***offset (off)*** on either side of each systolic peak which indicate the start and end of the pulse wave, respectively.

## Installation
Available on pip, with the command:
***pip install pyPPG***

pip project: https://pypi.org/project/pyPPG/

For more details see the [pyPPG example code](https://pyppg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/pyPPG_example.html) and [pyPPG YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VoMQ3FNjrM)

## Requirements
### Python Requirements:

Python == 3.10

scipy == 1.9.1

numpy == 1.23.2

dotmap == 1.3.30

pandas == 1.5.0

wfdb == 4.0.0

mne == 1.5.0

All the python requirements are installed when the toolbox is installed, so there is no need for any additional commands.

## Documentation:

## The main components:
1. **Software**
    - An open-source algorithmic ***pyPPG*** toolbox, which loads a PPG signal, preprocesses it, segments individual pulse waves, identifies fiducial points, and calculates a set of biomarkers. This can be used within your own data analysis code using the ***pyPPG*** API.
2. **Databases**
    - The ***pyPPG*** signal analysis is based on the following datasets:
      - [BIDMC Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/bidmc/1.0.0/)
      - [MESA Dataset](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/mesa)
    - Further PPG datasets:
      - [Collection of Peter Charlton](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/post/ppg_datasets/)
      - [Collection of Physionet](https://physionet.org/content/?topic=ppg)

All PPG measures can be further adapted for the analysis for efficient heart rate measurement as well as health assessment with clinically relevant biomarkers.
